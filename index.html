<h1>Title: Enabling Creation Research and Evangelism in Brisbane</h1>

<p>Since joining Creation Ministries International 4 years ago, I have been dedicated to upskilling myself in the field of Creation/Evolution, preparing for high-exposure debates. My goal is to expose falsehoods and illuminate the truths of Godâ€™s testimony through creation.</p>

<p>Currently, I have the opportunity to embark on a PhD in Galactic Astrophysics. This endeavor will not only enhance my skills but also provide a larger platform to speak and influence the ongoing public debate on creation and evolution. I am seeking funding to undertake the PhD program full-time. This will allow me to continue to devote time (hopefully more so) to spreading the Gospel and engaging in discipleship efforts in Brisbane.</p>

<h2>Could this be done without funding?</h2>

<p>While it is possible for me to pursue the PhD while working, the timeline would likely stretch to 10 years. Many PhDs completed on this extended timeline remain unfinished. Furthermore, I would need to scale back my involvement in preaching the Gospel in the city center, as well as other important prayer and discipleship activities.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Seven years ago, my wife and I moved to Australia with a clear calling from the Lord to be missionaries in this country. Throughout this time, I have been engaged in preaching the Gospel in the city center of Brisbane, actively participated in a prayer and worship movement (including leadership and oversight), worked on building a strong community, and most recently, provided mentorship to young believers. All of these efforts are aimed at sparking revival both in Australia and around the world.</p>
