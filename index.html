<h1>Title: Enabling Creation Research and Evangelism in Brisbane</h1>

<p>Since joining Creation Ministries International 4 years ago, I have been dedicated to upskilling myself in the field of Creation/Evolution, preparing for high-exposure debates. My goal is to expose falsehoods and illuminate the truths of Godâ€™s testimony through creation.</p>

<p>Currently, I have the opportunity to embark on a PhD in Galactic Astrophysics. This endeavor will not only enhance my skills but also provide a larger platform to speak and influence the ongoing public debate on creation and evolution. I am seeking funding to undertake the PhD program full-time. This will allow me to continue to devote time (hopefully more so) to spreading the Gospel and engaging in discipleship efforts in Brisbane.</p>

<h2>Could this be done without funding?</h2>

<p>While it is possible for me to pursue the PhD while working, the timeline would likely stretch to 10 years. Many PhDs completed on this extended timeline remain unfinished. Furthermore, I would need to scale back my involvement in preaching the Gospel in the city center, as well as other important prayer and discipleship activities.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I moved to Australia with my wife 7 years ago, on a word form the Lord with the understanding that we were to be missionaries here in Australia. Throughout that time, I have preached the gospel in the city centre of Brisbane, been invested in a prayer/worship movement (leadership, participation, and oversight), sought to develop community, and more recently provided mentorship to younger believers. All with the aim of seeing revival here in Australia and across the world.</p>

<h2>Prayer and Worship</h2>
<p>I greatly appreciated being apart of interceeding for a recent worship event in Queensland, where about 1000 people gathred for 52 hours of worship in a field. I serve in a spiritual leadership capacity for the gorup that put the event on. Audio clips from the event are below. I found a new level of jelousy for God to get the Glory in the weeks of prayer leading up to the event.</p>
